# iOS Project Description

## The project

For the iOS assignment I will be developing a game called **Multitap**. 
The gameplay will consist of different colored blocks falling down. 
The game has one main color that changes over time. 
Depending on that color, the player must click on the correspondingly colored falling blocks. 
For example if the main color is red, the player must click on all red falling blocks until the main color changes. 
Upon tapping the block, the player gets points and destroys the block. 
Some falling blocks are special and require double tapping to be destroyed. 
Sometimes they can give cool bonuses. When a user beats his previous record, they can take a victory selfie! 
Also highscores are a thing.

## Points of functionality

- Randomly generated falling blocks.
- Randomly picked main color.
- Highscore system (local and global)
- Game gradually becomes faster.
- Options for sound control.
- Take selfies.
- Get location of the player who beat his record.
